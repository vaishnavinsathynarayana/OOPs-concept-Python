                                                ~~ OOPs CONCEPT in PYTHON ~~
This repository contains Python programs demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
The goal is to provide clear and practical examples of how OOP principles can be applied in Python programming

**Explain what OOP is and why it's important?** <br>
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize and manage software. It helps in modeling real-world entities and their interactions, making code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key OOP concepts and their importance:

**Key OOP Concepts** <br>

**Classes** are blueprints for creating objects. They define a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have. <br>

**Objects** are instances of classes. They encapsulate both data and behavior defined in the class. <br>
Example: A Car class might have attributes like color and model, and methods like drive() and brake(). An object of the Car class would be a specific car like a redToyotaCorolla.

**Inheritance** <br>
Inheritance allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (base class or parent class). <br>
This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.<br>
Example: A ElectricCar class might inherit from a Car class, gaining all its properties and methods while also adding new features like batteryLife.<br>

**Polymorphism**<br>
Polymorphism enables a single interface to be used for different underlying data types. It allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the object that invokes them.
This includes method overriding (subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass) and method overloading (same method name with different parameters).
Example: The Car class might have a honk() method that is overridden in the ElectricCar class to produce a different sound.

**Importance of OOP**<br>
- Modularity: OOP promotes breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable pieces (classes and objects).<br>
- Reusability: Inheritance allows code to be reused, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.<br>
- Maintainability: Encapsulation hides the internal state of objects and exposes only necessary parts, making it easier to modify and maintain code.<br>
- Flexibility and Scalability: Polymorphism and inheritance make it easier to extend and scale the codebase.<br>

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
